# AI Coding Tools Weekly Survey

This is the repository for the AI Coding Tools Weekly Survey. It is a web-based survey platform designed to track the evolving landscape of AI-powered coding tools through weekly community feedback.

> **Note**: The structure and UI of this survey are heavily influenced by the [State of JS surveys](https://stateofjs.com/). We're grateful for their pioneering work in developer survey design and user experience.
