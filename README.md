# State of Rands AI Coding Tools

A survey system for gauging interest and usage of AI coding tools in the Rands AI Coding Tools Slack channel.

This survey system is similar to the [State of JavaScript](https://stateofjs.com/) and related surveys. Users are asked for demographic information and then asked to answer a series of questions about their usage of AI coding tools, frameworks, libraries, platforms, and other related tools.

Every week, a new survey will be posted in the channel with a link to the survey, and participants will be able to visit the site and respond to the survey as well as view view the results. This system is intendend to be private to the Rands community but accessible without authentication (security by obscurity). The Rands Leadership Slack abides by the Chatham House Rule.
